# Weather-App

This app is a forecast app, the user can enter any city/country around the world and he will get a forecast for next day or five days (according to his choice).
Any kind of weather has it's own icon (from OpenWeather) and a picture for more pleasing design for the user.
The data for the forecast is coming from OpenWeather by an api request, this data comes in JSON format.
This project is done with: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, the jQuery is used locally so there is a JS file just for that.
